#Creating a webserver that hosts a static webpage using Ningx.
first we Update the systemâ€™s packages by using: sudo apt update
Second step is to install NINGX by using:  sudo apt install nginx
third step is to  Verify the installation by checking version of NGINX using: nginx -v
fourth step is to Get the status of the NGINX service:  sudo systemctl status nginx
Nginx is enable using the: sudo systemctl enable nginx
Nginx is restart using the following command: sudo systemctl restart nginx
Nginx is start using the following command: sudo systemctl start nginx
Firewall to allow the HTTP traffic on port 80 and HTTP port 443 using: sudo ufw allow 'Nginx full'
the reload to make changes: sudo ufw reload
Fifth step is to create a directory (data) under the root directory to store the website data then create a directory to store the html file in the data directory(www)
then change the ownership of the www directory to make it more flexible to access using the chown (name of user):(group of user) www
then in the www direcory we create the html file
then we make the /data/www directory which contains the html file to point to the Nginx.conf file by remaining the existing nginx.conf file and create a new nginx.conf file
that points to the html file
then this config file is put inside that points to the location of the html file created :
events {
}
http {
server {
location / {
root /data/www;
}
}
}
each website will have a events block is there is a mutiple website
then check if there is no error in the changes made: sudo nginx -t
then reload nginx to update its settings: sudo service nginx reload
